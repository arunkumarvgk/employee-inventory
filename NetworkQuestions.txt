Default GateWay in IP?

A default gateway allows the devices in one network to communicate with devices in another network. To be able to communicate with other IP networks a router must be used.
Default Gateway can connect to more than one IP network and can route traffic between those IP networks.
The router will have its own IP address on each IP network that it connects to.

SNAT and DNAT

SNAT is Source Network Address Translation. SNAT changes the source address of the packets passing through the Router, is typically used when an internal
host needs to initiate a session to an external host.

DNAT is Destination Network Address Translation. DNATchanges the destination address of packets passing through the Router. DNAT is typically used when an 
external host needs to initiate a session with an internal host.

ARP ?

Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) is a protocol that is used to resolve the IP Addresses to MAC Addresses(Physical Address of the device).
Let us say that computer A  wants to communicate with Computer B, Computer A already knows the IP Address of computer B but it still needs the MAC Address of computer B,
Now computer A will internally look into the ARP cache to see if computer B's IP Address has a matching MAC Address if it is not available then computer A 
sends a broad message to check which computer has Computer B's MAC Address, once Computer A receives Computer B's MAC Address it starts communicating.

There are 2 different types of ARP entries
Dynamic: Created automatically when a device sends outs broadcast message to the network.
Static: Someone manually enters the IP-MAC mapping.
